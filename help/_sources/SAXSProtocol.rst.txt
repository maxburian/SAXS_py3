The Saxsdog Network Protocol
----------------------------

The Saxsdog Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The saxdog server can watch for files ystem events for himself  or subscribe to a zmq service, the Saxsdog Feeder, that publishes new file names. The server can process the new images according to one  calibration. The server may only have one calibration at a time, it is not designed to be used  by multiple users at the same time.



The Saxsdog Feeder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Saxsdog Feeder" service offers file events for subscription. It should not do any buffering or pre-selection, just send a new  message when any new file was copied and is ready for processing. Also when a file is overwritten: Send a message. It should however,  only send this event, when the file is completely written to the file system.


New file events are composed of the following message:

.. code:: json
  
   {
      "command":"new file",
      "argument":"/Path/to/file/"
   }

The service must be a ZeroMQ ``zmq.PUP`` socket. This code is a simulation of the messages:

.. literalinclude :: ../SAXS/Feeder.py

The Saxsdog Leash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Saxsdog Leash is a user-facing control interface.  There, the user should enter new calibrations and specify the data directories connected to it.  During the processing, it shows a graph of one of the current images.

It may send the following commands:
